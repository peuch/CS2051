# AES Project
Members: David Calderon, Pedro Chen, Reese Wang


## Overall steps
1. Do AES implementation (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKeys) and expand the given key for encryption. **Due Wednesday**
2. Do AES implemenation for decryption. **Due Thursday**
3. Develop algorithms to crack AES. **Due Saturday**
4. Test out how effective these algorithms work on different variations of AES. See what parameters allow for us to crack AES in a reasonable amount of time. Perhaps we can prove that it is or is not very reliable. **Due Sunday**

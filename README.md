Members: David Calderon, Pedro Chen, Reese Wang


## Overall steps
1. Do AES implementation (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKeys) and expand the given key for encryption. Wednesday
2. Do AES implemenation for decryption. Wednesday
3. Develop algorithms to crack AES. Thursday
4. Test out how effective these algorithms work on different variations of AES. See what parameters allow for us to crack AES in a reasonable amount of time. Perhaps we can prove that it is or is not very reliable. Friday
